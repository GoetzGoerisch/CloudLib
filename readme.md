#CloudLib GraphQL Prototype

This prototype is an exploration of using GraphQL to explore an OPC UA Information Model, for the OPC/CESMII Cloud Library Joint Working Group. Its posted for reference only, and is not a real-world implementation -- nor will this code base ever become one.

The decision about the CloudLib API is still pending the JWG's continued exploration and decision.
